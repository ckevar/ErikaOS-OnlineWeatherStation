# ErikaOs-OnlineWeatherStation
It drags weather information from OpenWeather.org using location based on ip-api.com.
## Hardware 
It's a _STM32f407-discovery_ using _std_ library mounted over a _dicover-more_ extension board. This board also includes a LCD. 
The ESP8266 is connected through UART in the COM1 (USART6 on the _discovery_ PC6-PC7 pins) on the _std_ library. ESP8266's reset/GPIO0/GIPO2/Enable pin are fixed voltage, meaning they are not connected to any STM32's GPIOS.

## How to run/flash it
if the hardware is ready, The file _c_mX.bin_ can be flashed as follows:
``` bash
$ st-flash write c_mX.bin 0x8000000
```

## Recompile
In order to recompile you need to download ERIKA2.x-OS from https://www.erika-enterprise.com/index.php/download/erika-v2.x.html
Once Erika is intall, you only need the Erika-CLI not the whole Eclipse to work. So, everything usefull executable you need is under the _evidence_ folder.

### Step 1
Generate files from configuration file _conf.oil_ 

``` bash
$ erika-gen /path/where/Erika-CLI/is/installed/Erika-CLI/ conf.oil .
```

### step 1
add _usr.mk_ inside makefile

``` bash
$ nano makefile
```
in the first line write:

``` bash
$ include usr.mk
```
## step 3
You also need to install _gcc-arm-none-eabi_.
Edit usr.mk, to address where the gcc-arm-none-eabi compiler is installed
``` bash
$ nano usr.mk
```

Locate the line that starts with _GNU_ARM_ROOT_ and change it by the path where your compiler is installed.

## Requirements
- Erika2.x OS (the operating system of the board)
- gcc-arm-none-eabi (to compile the project)
- stlink (to flash the board)
